<font size="5"><b>What is Lucid Dreaming?</b></font><br>
<p>
	Lucid dreaming is when you’re conscious during a dream. This typically happens during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the dream-stage of sleep.
	An estimated 55 percent of people have had one or more lucid dreams in their lifetime.
	During a lucid dream, you’re aware of your consciousness. It’s a form of metacognition, or awareness of your awareness. Often, lucid dreaming also lets you control what happens in your dream.
	Some people report that lucid dreams feel very vivid and real, while others say they feel a bit hazier. Others say their lucid dreams feel different every time.

       <b><li>USE A DREAM JOURNAL.</li></b><br>
Keeping a dream journal, or dream diary, is a popular method for initiating lucid dreaming. When you write down your dreams, you’re forced to remember what happens during each dream. It’s said to help you recognize dreamsigns and enhance awareness of your dreams. For best results, log your dreams as soon as you wake up. It’s also recommended to read your dream journal often.<br>

       <b><li>DEVELOP REALITY-TESTING SYSTEM.</li></b><br>
       <details>
<summary><ins>What is reality testing?</ins></summary><br>
The concept of reality testing was introduced by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, who used it to determine whether patients could separate the external world from their own thoughts and feelings.Reality testing can also help you overcome cognitive biases that might be holding you back.<br>
The practice of reality testing can be applied by anyone in everyday life.

<br>Here are a few things to keep in mind when doing this:<br>
<br>
1. Try to be objective and analyse the situation from as many points of view as possible.<br>
2. Consider the possibility that you misinterpreted the situation. <br>
3. Acknowledge other people’s thoughts and feelings.<br>
4. Think first, act later.<br>
5. Try to spot patterns in your emotional reactions. <br>

7. Practice emotional reasoning.<br>
8. Ask a friend what they think about the situation.<br>
<br>
